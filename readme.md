When people think about communicating data they often gravitate towards graphics and interactive visualizations, thinking that these are the only options. But why stop at the sense of sight?!? There are many other methods of perception, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, that can be used to enhance and augment own ability to present data. In this workshop you will explore the tools, theory, and techniques of sonifying data (as well as little history of how we got to where we are today) for both creative and informational uses.

If you have ever wanted to break past the limits of the eye and explore alternative methods of visualizing data, this workshop is for you! You WILL learn how to trigger sounds based on data and user interaction, modulate audio (pitch, tempo, etc.), and "play" a CSV using p5.js (with a little D3.js thrown in). In this workshop you WON'T learn how to create synthesizers, work with waveforms, or process sonic textures unfortunately (there are other workshops for that). Basic programming experience (ideally with Javascript) is necessary but experience with p5.js or D3.js is not required (or assumed).

#### Exercise

1. [Loading Data](prince/index.html)
2. [Triggering Audio](prince/index2.html)
3. [Sonic Modulation](weather/index.html)
4. [User Interaction](theremin/index.html)
5. [Sequencing](theremin/matrix.html)

<!-- ### 1: Triggering Audio (beats)


### 2: Modulating Audio

#### Amplitude

#### Frequency/Pitch

#### Tempo/Timing

#### Filters

### Exercise

Rather than loading the NASA temperature data, use [this NYC weather data](https://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/raw/2fffa9abe50ac97603c7/cloud_rain_freeze.json) (from Elijah Meeks [visualization](https://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/2fffa9abe50ac97603c7))

### 3: Editorializing Audio

## Static Data

## Real time!

#### Composition/Arrangement

#### Sequencing/Chords

## Sonification Examples -->
